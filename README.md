# Dissertation Presentation Scheduling

*We're doing things this way to give you a bit more experience with GitHub, repos, forking, and pull requests (PR).*

**Instructions:** [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repository, [pull any updates from the main repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork) ([instructions for doing this via github.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20984802/how-can-i-keep-my-fork-in-sync-without-adding-a-separate-remote/21131381#21131381)), make your updates, and commit as a new branch with a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

*I would encourage you to read the pages linked above so that you understand the process.  A walk-through of the steps is available at [fork-PR-steps.md](fork-PR-steps.md)*

**Updates (Mar 18, 2020)**
* Since we are online for the rest of the semester, we will no longer be using the in-class presentation schedule. (And I have removed that section below.) All presentations are due by **Tues, Apr 14 at 5pm**.
* I will post here, on Piazza, and on our class schedule a document with the new procedure for creating and submitting your presentation.
* Dissertation presentation procedure: https://github.com/cs800-research-spr20/assignments/blob/master/Dissertation.md
